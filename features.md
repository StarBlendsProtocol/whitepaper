### $BUSD Reflections

Earn automatic $BUSD rewards by holding your Star Blend Token. 6% of every Buy/Sell transaction is redistributed automatically to Star Blend eligible holders. You will receive the rewards automatically in your wallet.
{% endhint %}

### Liquidity Pool

Our contract deposits 1% from every Buy/Sell transaction as Star Blend Token and $BNB into a liquidity pool which has been locked and certified. A bigger liquidity pool will provide more stability to the Star Blend price.

### Anti-Whale Mechanism

Our Anti-Whale Mechanism ensures that no single sell order can amount to more than 0.1% of the total supply of Star Blend. The Anti-Whale Mechanism won‚Äôt necessarily stop Whales from selling, but having a maximum limit helps to prevent large selloffs and price manipulation.
